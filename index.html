I am currently a third year student at the University of Toronto - pursuing a Honours Bachelor of Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Data Mining. I am currently working as a Project Management Analyst at Investors Group.  Prior to Investors Group, I was a Project Control Officer/ IT Project Control Coordinator at CIBC. During my time at CIBC, I was tracking applications that are suitable candidates to migrate to cloud platforms. Furthermore, I was responsible for designing and implementing the Program Database, which consolidates various information about projects such as their status, financials, and governance.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">Lastly, I had worked as a Web Analyst at West Corporation. During my time at West, I was able to gain experience in Web Development, Quality Assurance, and Software Development. My co-worker and I helped devleoped an application to automate online forms. The application reduced the time to create forms by up to 2 hours!! :)
